# Migraine

Migraine is an attempt to create a full environment for chip8 made of an emulator, a debugger, an assembler, a disassembler and a compiler

It's called Migraine because trust me, this project is a real headache

## Status

- The emulator is good
- The renderer is great
- The sound is good
- The debugger is ok
- The assembler is half ok
- The disassembler is still in very early stages
- The compiler is still just a dream for now

The road is still very long but I'll make it work (or so I want to believe)
